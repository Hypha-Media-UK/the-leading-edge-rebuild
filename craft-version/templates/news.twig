This trend focuses on enhancing your hair\'s natural texture rather than fighting against it. Our stylists recommend using sea salt sprays and diffusing techniques to achieve that perfect "just-left-the-beach" look.</p><h4>Bold Color Statements</h4><p>While natural textures are trending, color choices are becoming more adventurous. We\'re seeing clients opt for vibrant highlights, sunset-inspired ombres, and even temporary color washes that can be changed with the seasons.</p><h4>Low-Maintenance Cuts</h4><p>Busy summer schedules call for hairstyles that look great with minimal styling. Layered cuts, long bobs, and textured pixie cuts are perfect for those who want to look polished without spending hours on their hair.</p>'
